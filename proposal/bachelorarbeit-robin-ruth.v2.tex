\chapter{Motivation}
With the ongoing digitalisation and the generation of big data in most aspects of society, data driven approaches to every day problems become more and more viable. One way to evaluate these large datasets is with a machine learning approach. Machine learning, though powerfull, has its own chalenges. Not every machine learning approach is applicable for every problem, not every algorithm will perform in reasonable time on every data, the list goes on.

A lot of intimate knowledge and intuition about machine learning algorithms is needed to select a good approach to your given problem. Knowledge and intuition that is only developed in few experts. Even then, to optimize for a given problem still requires a lot of trial and error, as most of the time the best hyperparameter settings can only be found by trial and error.

To automate this process, DAI-Labor (Distributed Artifical Intelligence) and GT-ARC (German Turkish Advanced Research Center for ICT) have started CODA, a fundamental resarch project in algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimisation. \cite{CODA-Steckbrief}

With this project, nicknamed Sparked, we create an interface to the CODA project, allowing machine learning enthusiasts and specialists to use the developed solutions and giving the team an interface to demonstrate CODAs capabilities.

As such we will provide a user interface that is usable in demonstrations and can be used by persons with a background in machine learning without prior training. As such a focus is set on a clean workflow, good user guidance and a visual appealing display.






\chapter{Objective}
The overall objectiv of Sparked is to create a web application and a supporting backend to interface with the CODA backend. 

To develop Sparked an architecture has to be chosen. This includes which languages and technologies will be used in the development process. 

\section{Architecture}

The architecture has to support several use cases:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Demonstration startup
  
  It should be easy to spin up a clean Sparked instance with empty databases for demonstration purposes. Sensible defaults should apply, to make such an instance immediatelly usable even by an untrained individual.

  \item Configurability

  Changing the CODA Backend should be possible without recompile.

  \item Docker deployment

  Sparked has to run in docker containers on a linux system.

\end{itemize}

Some common characteristics of web applications are not relevant in this project:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Useraccounts

  All Users will operate on the same data. There will not be any useraccounts. Any data uploaded to Sparked is visible to all other users.
  \item Login

  The UI will be open and not contain any login features or any other form of access controll.
\end{itemize}

Coda will run on a seperate machine, connected via a Kafka bus system. Kafka access is not part of the Sparked project. An encapsulation library written in Java will be provided.

\section{Workflows}

Sparked contains several workflows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Order creation

  An order can be created. This includes the selection of all values needed to create an order. classifier, metric, test dataset and validation method with their respective parameters.

  After an order is created, it will be split in tasks and put into a queue for processing. This includes persisting them to have a keep them in data on restart.

  \item Test data

  While creating an order, the user may select from a pool of testdata but may also chose to upload their own sets. Uploaded files have to be redirected to CODA to allow usage in the evaluation process.

  The data will not be validated in Sparked. Correctly formatted data will be assumed.

  \item Order overview

  View all orders, with their tasks and allows them to be paused or continued if not finished. A Sparked instance will connect to a single backend. 

  \item Order evaluation
  
  Display an evaluation page for order and task results.
\end{itemize}

It is not possible to access several CODA backends at the same time. 

Sparked does not contain any evaluation logic or machine learning support itself. As such it is dependent on the data returned from CODA via Kafka.

\section{Evaluation}

To evaluate the the usability and user interface decissions, a think-aloud interview will be conducted. This method helps to understand the expectations a user has at a given point in a workflow and shows if the user is able to use the application in a successfull manner without prior knowledge of the program or if help is needed.

The results of the think aloud interview will be discussed in this thesis, but not influnece the actual development. Ideally a think aloud interview would be followed by a secondary development block to address the found factors. Instead the results will be collected for possible future projects.

The think aloud interview is not supposed to be a statistical evaluation, the number of participants does not have to be statistically significant. 

\chapter{Work packages}
