\chapter{Motivation}
With the ongoing digitalization and the generation of big data in most aspects of society, data driven approaches to every day problems become more and more viable. One way to evaluate these large datasets is with a machine learning approach. Machine learning, though powerful, has its own challenges. Not every machine learning approach is applicable for every problem, not every algorithm will perform in reasonable time on every data, the list goes on.

A lot of intimate knowledge and intuition about machine learning algorithms is needed to select a good approach to a given problem. Knowledge and intuition that is only developed in few experts. Even then, to optimize for a given problem still requires a lot of time, as most of the time the best hyperparameter settings can only be found by trial and error.

To automate this process, GT-ARC (German Turkish Advanced Research Center for ICT) has started CODA, a fundamental research project in algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization. \cite{CODA-Steckbrief}

This project creates an interface to the CODA project, allowing machine learning enthusiasts and specialists to use the developed solutions and giving the team an interface to demonstrate CODAs capabilities.

The provided user interface may be used in demonstrations as well as by persons with a background in machine learning. The focus is set on a clean workflow, good user guidance and a visual appealing display.




\chapter{Objective}
The overall objective is to create a web application and a supporting backend to interface with the CODA backend. 

Architecture, languages and technologies will not be predefined. Selecting these is part of this project.

\section{Architecture}

The architecture has to support several use cases:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Demonstration startup
  
  It should be easy to spin up a clean instance with empty databases for demonstration purposes. Sensible defaults should apply, to make such an instance immediately usable even by an untrained individual.

  \item Configurability

  Changing the CODA Backend should be possible without recompile.

  \item Docker deployment

  The System has to run in docker containers on linux.

\end{itemize}

Some common characteristics of web applications are not relevant in this project:
\begin{itemize}
  \item User accounts

  All Users will operate on the same data. There will not be any user accounts. Any data uploaded is visible to all other users.
  \item Login

  The UI will be open and not contain any login features or any other form of access control.

  \item Responsiveness

  The UI will not be responsiv, mobile usage will not be the focus. A resolution of at least 1024x768 will be assumed.
\end{itemize}

Coda will run on a separate machine, connected via Kafka-REST-Api. Kafka access is not part of this project. An encapsulation library written in Java will be provided.

\section{Workflows}

Several workflows will be supported:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Order creation

  An order can be created. This includes the selection of all values needed to create an order, classifier, metric, test dataset and validation method with their respective parameters.

  After an order is created, it will be split in tasks and put into a queue for processing. This includes persisting them to have a keep them in data on restart.

  \item Test data

  While creating an order, the user may select from a pool of test data but may also chose to upload their own sets. Uploaded files have to be redirected to CODA to allow usage in the evaluation process.

  The data will not be validated on upload. Validation occurs only within CODA.

  \item Order overview

  View all orders, with their tasks and allows them to be paused or continued if not finished. An instance will connect to a single backend. Changing the connected backend should only occur if the order list is empty.

  \item Order evaluation
  
  Display an evaluation page for order and task results.
\end{itemize}

It is not possible to access multiple CODA backends at the same time. 

All evaluation logic or machine learning support will be provided by CODA. As such this project is dependent on the data returned from CODA. Neither does it contain an error logic. If an error occurs in CODA, no help will be provided besides showing the error message that comes from CODA. Correct configuration and service setup will be assumed. 

\section{Evaluation}

To evaluate the usability and user interface decisions, a think-aloud interview will be conducted. This method helps to understand the expectations a user has at a given point in a workflow and shows if the user is able to use the application in a successful manner without prior knowledge of the program or if help is needed.

The results of the think aloud interview will be discussed in this thesis, but not influence the actual development. Ideally a think aloud interview would be followed by a secondary development block to address the found factors. Instead the results will be collected for possible future projects.

The think aloud interview is not supposed to be a statistical evaluation, the number of participants does not have to be statistically significant. 

\chapter{Work packages}

\section{Introduction}

Define the overall goal of this project.

\section{Basis}

Introduce relevant concepts and definitions of Machine-Learning and usability design in general and CODA in particular. 

\section{Requirement definition}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Specify requirements and usecases, feedback

  The general requirements have already been discussed. Specifying them and understanding the usecases for the final product will help understand the needed solution.

  A feedback loop will help find and solve misunderstandings.

\end{itemize}

\section{Solution approcach}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Workflowdesign

  Design workflows from an usability point of view. 

  \item UI Design

  Create a user interface design. Start with a design sketch for feedback and create a final design from that.

  \item Architektur

  Find a fitting architecture for the defined problem.

  \item Identify standard problems

  Many problems in IT are the same in most programms. Recognizing these and finding fitting solutions will speed up the development process and raise the overall code quality. 
  
\end{itemize}

\section{State of the art}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Analysing projects with a similar focus on ai and data analysis.

  Analysing other programs with the same overall purposes can help find good solutions and may also help identify pitfalls.

  \item Find common problems and standard solutions. 
  
  Selecting the right languages and libraries will help circumvent problems and will reduce the workload to the parts that are actually unique in this project.
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation}

The general setup is very similar in all web programs and software projects. CODA connection, Docker setup and the deployment are requirements that are already defined.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Basic setup
  \item Order creation
  \item Data persistence
  \item Basic user interface
  \item Test data upload
  \item Order overview page
  \item Integrating Kafka access library / CODA connection
  \item Configuration page
  \item Order evaluation
  \item UI optimization  
  \item Bug fixing
  \item Docker setup
  \item Final deployment on DAI server
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Create a questionnaire.
  
  Create questions and tasks for the interviewed. They should show if a new user is capable of navigating the application, to identify pain points and if they can complete a given objective.

  \item Find a testgroup for think aloud interview

  Select a set of 2-4 people of possible futute users to conduct the interview with.

  \item Evaluate interview

  Where are problem points in the program, where there objectives the interviewed could not solve.

\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion and Finalization}

Finalize the project, discuss possible future changes on the basis of the think aloud interview.
