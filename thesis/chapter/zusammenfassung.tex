\chapter*{Abstract}
In this project, a web-based user interface for the machine learning software CODA is developed. From the basic requirements of creating a visually attractive web application used primarily for presentations that supports all the capabilities of an existing API, the full stack of software development will be shown from an empty page to the finished product.
